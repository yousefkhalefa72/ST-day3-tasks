1- mypwd: print working directory (check `man getcwd`)
2- myecho: print a user input string on stdout (for example:  `echo Hello World`)
3- mymv: move a file to another place (might be with different name).
4- Femto support built-in echo, pwd and cd, in addition to exit. 
       - Implement a simple parser to parse the command line entered by the user,
       - divide it to arguments (the only supported separator is the space)
         and act according to the first argument.
       - If the user entered any thing other than (echo, pwd, cd, exit)
         you should print and error.
